Does your mom worry about you when you have to catch a flight, disable that amazon prime memebership you got for free, or email for a job before deadline?

Our app sends you a text reminding you if you have to respond to any email, catch a flight or do anything urgent. It even calls you before the time of the event, giving you a personal reminder.
